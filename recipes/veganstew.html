		<h3> A Vegan Favorite! </h3>
		<p> Ever since I was a little kid, I have craved beef stew. The soft vegetables, and the delicious broth always had me coming back for seconds. Now that I'm an adult, I've realized how expensive beef can be! This recipe is perfect for vegans, or for someone who wants to satisfy that craving of warm stew without having to spend a bunch of money.
		
		<ul>
		<li> 4 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (try to pick a very neutral flavor light one, not a dark tomato/carrot one or the taste will be off) </li>
		<li> 1 1/2 cups (235g) finely chopped white or yellow onion (1 very large onion) </li>
		<li> 5 extra large cloves garlic (you will need 1 packed tablespoon of minced garlic (15 g))</li>
		<li>1 heaping cup (170g) of sliced carrots </li>
		<li> 3/4 cup (182g) dry red wine (not sweet) cabernet sauvignon (or a merlot)
optional: 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast </li>
		<li> 2 lbs red potatoes chopped in 1 inch chunks </li>
		<li> 1 heaping cup (266g) tomato sauce/puree </li>
		<li> 2 1/2 tablespoons dried Italian seasoning with no red pepper or salt added, I use my homemade blend</li>
		<li> 2 teaspoons fine sea salt </li>
		<li> 1/2 teaspoon black pepper </li>
		</ul>
		
		<ol>
			<li>First, add ONLY 1 cup of the broth to a large pot with the onions, garlic and carrots. Turn to medium heat and once the liquid is bubbling, cook 5-8 minutes until onions are tender.  </li>
			<li> Add the wine and nutritional yeast (if using) and stir well. Continue to cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes so the wine cooks down some. 5 minutes is plenty. </li>
			<li> Add the remaining broth (3 1/2 cups), potatoes, tomato sauce, Italian herbs, salt and pepper. Turn to high heat and bring to a rolling boil. Once fully boiling, cover with a lid and turn the heat to low.</li>
			<li>Cook on low simmering for 30-45 minutes until the potatoes and carrots are tender. Check it a few times during and stir and check the veggies for doneness so they don't overcook. </li>
			<li> Taste and add any extra pepper/salt, etc. Garnish with fresh rosemary and thyme, if desired.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3> Gigi Hadid's Famous Recipe </h3>
		<p> Sometimes, it can be hard to cook after a long day at work. All I want is to curl up in bed and relax instead of spending an hour cooking up dinner. On those nights, my go to recipe is this vodka pasta, created by model and influencer Gigi Hadid. You would think a recipe made by a celebrity would be a complicated and expensive dish, but this one is quite the opposite! 
		
		<ul>
		<li> ¼ cup olive oil </li>
		<li> ¼ green onion </li>
		<li> ¼ cup tomato paste </li>
		<li> ½ cup heavy cream </li>
		<li> 1 tablespoon vodka </li>
		<li> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes </li>
		<li> 225 grams of shells pasta </li>
		<li> 1 tablespoon butter</li>
		<li> ¼ cup parmesan cheese</li>
		<li> Basil, chopped, to serve </li>
		</ul>
		
		<ol>
		<li> In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil, garlic and onion. Cook until soft. Add tomato paste and cook until it appears “darker [in colour] / a bit caramelised”, says Hadid.</li>
		<li>Add in the heavy cream. Add in the vodka and cook through until evaporated.</li>
		<li> Add in the red pepper flakes. [There is a special note from the chef here to add in more flakes if you like your pasta extra spicy].</li>
		<li>Keep stirring until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Remove sauce from the heat.</li>
		<li> Cook pasta separately. The chef uses shells but Orecchiette would also work well. When the pasta is done, save ¼ of the pasta water before draining.</li>
		<li>Add in the butter. Stir over a medium heat til the butter has melted and the sauce is “sauccyyyy”, says Hadid.</li>
		<li>Add pasta – and the pasta water – to the sauce. Add parmesan cheese and stir. Add more salt and pepper to taste.</li>
		<li>Top with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese and basil to serve.</li>
		
		
		</ol>
